# **Problem Statement**

Write a Python program that accepts a string from the user and displays characters present at even index positions.

**Input:**

- A string `str` (1 <= len(str) <= 1000), where `str` is the input string provided by the user.

**Output:**

- The original string.
- The characters present at even index positions in the string.

**Example:**

**Input:**
```
Enter a string: pynative
```

**Output:**
```
Original String is  pynative
Printing only even index chars
p
n
t
v
```

**Note:**

- The input string can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and special characters.
- Index positions start from 0.
- Ensure that the program handles both uppercase and lowercase characters in the input string.
