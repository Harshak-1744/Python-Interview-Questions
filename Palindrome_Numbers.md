## Problem Statement: Palindrome Numbers

You are tasked with creating a program or function that determines whether a given integer is a palindrome or not. A palindrome number is one that reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Input:
- An integer `num` to be checked for palindrome property.

### Output:
- A boolean value indicating whether the input integer is a palindrome (True) or not (False).

#### Sample Input 1:
```python
num1 = 121
```

#### Sample Output 1:
```python
True
```

Explanation: The integer 121 reads the same forwards and backwards, making it a palindrome.

---

#### Sample Input 2:
```python
num2 = -121
```

#### Sample Output 2:
```python
False
```

Explanation: Negative integers are not considered palindromes. Therefore, -121 is not a palindrome.

---

#### Sample Input 3:
```python
num3 = 10
```

#### Sample Output 3:
```python
False
```

Explanation: The integer 10 is not the same when read backwards (01), so it is not a palindrome.
