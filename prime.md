## **Problem Statement:**

Write a program that takes an integer as input and determines whether it is a prime number or not. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.

## **Input:**

The input consists of a single integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), where n is the number to be checked for primality.

## **Output:**

The program should output "Prime" if the input number is prime, and "Not Prime" otherwise.

## **Sample Input 1:**

```
5
```

## **Sample Output 1:**

```
Prime
```

## **Explanation 1:**

The number 5 is only divisible by 1 and 5, so it is a prime number.

## **Sample Input 2:**

```
12
```

## **Sample Output 2:**

```
Not Prime
```

## **Explanation 2:**

The number 12 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, so it is not a prime number.

## **Sample Input 3:**

```
31
```

## **Sample Output 3:**

```
Prime
```

## **Explanation 3:**

The number 31 is only divisible by 1 and 31, so it is a prime number.
