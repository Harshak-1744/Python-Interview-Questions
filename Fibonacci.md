## Problem Statement: Fibonacci Series

You are tasked with writing a program or function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

### Input:
- An integer `n` representing the limit up to which the Fibonacci sequence should be generated.

### Output:
- A list of Fibonacci numbers up to the specified limit `n`.

#### Sample Input 1:
```python
n = 10
```

#### Sample Output 1:
```python
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence generated up to the limit of 10 is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]. Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

#### Sample Input 2:
```python
n = 5
```

#### Sample Output 2:
```python
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
```

Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence generated up to the limit of 5 is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5].

---

#### Sample Input 3:
```python
n = 0
```

#### Sample Output 3:
```python
[0]
```

Explanation: The Fibonacci sequence generated up to the limit of 0 consists only of the initial value, which is 0.
