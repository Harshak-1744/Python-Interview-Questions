# Create a function in Python

## **Problem Statement:**

You need to create a Python function named `print_name_and_age` that takes two arguments: `name` (a string) and `age` (an integer). The function should print the values of these arguments.

**Sample Input:**

```python
name = "John Doe"
age = 30
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Name: John Doe
Age: 30
```

**Note:** Replace `"John Doe"` and `30` with the actual values provided as input when calling the function.

**Sample Function Call:**

```python
print_name_and_age(name, age)
```

When you call the function with the provided input, it should print the name and age as shown in the sample output.
