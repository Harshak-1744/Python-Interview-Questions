## Problem Statement:
Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.

## Problem Description

You are tasked with creating a Python program that calculates and displays the sum of the current number and the previous number in a given range of numbers from 0 to 9. Initialize a variable called `initial` to 0 before entering the loop. During each iteration of the loop, update the `initial` variable to the current number and calculate the sum of the current number and the previous number. Finally, print the current number, the previous number, and their sum for each number in the range.

## Input

The program should take no input from the user. The range of numbers to be considered is fixed from 0 to 9.

## Output

For each number in the range from 0 to 9, the program should display the following information:

- The current number.
- The previous number.
- The sum of the current number and the previous number.

## Sample Output
```
Printing current and previous number sum in a range(10)

Current Number: 0 Previous Number: 0 Sum: 0
Current Number: 1 Previous Number: 0 Sum: 1
Current Number: 2 Previous Number: 1 Sum: 3
Current Number: 3 Previous Number: 2 Sum: 5
Current Number: 4 Previous Number: 3 Sum: 7
Current Number: 5 Previous Number: 4 Sum: 9
Current Number: 6 Previous Number: 5 Sum: 11
Current Number: 7 Previous Number: 6 Sum: 13
Current Number: 8 Previous Number: 7 Sum: 15
Current Number: 9 Previous Number: 8 Sum: 17

```
