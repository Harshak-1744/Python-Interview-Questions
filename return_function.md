# Return multiple values from a function

## **Problem Statement:**

Create a Python function named `calculation` that accepts two variables, calculates their addition and subtraction, and returns both results in a single return call.

**Sample Input:**

You can call the `calculation` function with two numerical variables as input.

**Sample 1:**

```python
a = 5
b = 3
```

**Sample 2:**

```python
a = 10
b = 7
```

**Sample Output:**

The function should return both the addition and subtraction results in a single return call.

**Sample 1 Output:**

```python
calculation(5, 3)
```

Output:

```python
(8, 2)
```

**Sample 2 Output:**

```python
calculation(10, 7)
